# Golf Caddy App

## Overview

This is a React Native app designed for my local Golf Club. It provides players with helpful advice and information on how to play each hole on the course. In addition to course guidance, users can input and track their scores during a round and use the group organiser to randomly shuffle players into groups for the round. Whether you're a local member or a visiting player, this app is a convenient digital companion to enhance your round.

## Planning

Planning started by using agile methodologies by delivering small features across the duration of the project. This broke down the build of the project into a lot more manageable parts and was able to select which user stories were more important to the site. The user stories were then used to help create wireframes to see how the user would navigate and use the app.

## User Experience

### The Strategy Plane

The Golf Caddy App was intended for people who play at my local golf course, who would like adivce on how to play the golf course, keep track of their scores and organise the players they have into random groups.

#### The Ideal User

- Someone who plays golf.
- Someone who is playing golf at my local golf club.

#### Site Goals

- Give golfers advice on how to play the golf course.
- Easy way for player to keep track of their scores.
- Easily place players into random groups to play with.

### Agile Planning

This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering small features across the duration of the project. This broke down the build of the project into a lot more manageable parts and was able to select which user stories were more important for the app.

It was carried out this way to try ensuring that all core requirements were completed first to give the project a complete feel and to make sure the most important user stories were implemented. When clicked on and opened the user story, the user story was assigned a label "must have", "should have" or "could have" so I would know the importance of the user story.

The kanban board was created using GitHub projects, this helped me be able to see all my user stories and be able to keep track of which ones had been done, to do or in progress.

Each User story was placed into it's own milestone iteration to help schedule the development of the project. These iterations can be set with dates but I did not do this due to fitting in around work and other commitments. In the iteration you can close a user story when finished, this will also keep track of how much is completed.

Milestones:

### The Scope Plane

This project was designed for both android and IOS devices. This app is to only to be operational in portrait.

### The Structure Plane

#### Features

As a user this app has been styled for android and IOS devices but has so far only be published for android devices.

As a user I want to see a clear way of navigating around the app so that I can easily find the relative information I am looking for.

The app has a bottom tab used for navigation, the user can easily see the navigations for each screen at the bottom of the device.

The bottom tab is displayed on all screens.

### The Surface Plane

#### Design

**_Colour Scheme_**

I opted for a very few choices of colours throughout the app. The same colours have been implemented across the site and are included in the button's styles.

This hopefully makes the site easy and clear to read / use.

The colour palette was created using the coolors website.

**_Imagery_**

Font awesome was used to for the sites icons.
