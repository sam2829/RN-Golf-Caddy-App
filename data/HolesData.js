    description: `This hole is par 3. If playing off the yellows its a nice 130 yards but if off the whites this can go up to 190 yards.

It's a straight par 3 with a stream running the entire length down the right hand side but there is plenty of room either side of this. Left is out of bounds and trees in the top left. 

There is a banking at the back of the green so here you are better off being short rather than long. The green also slopes from back to front which again makes life easier if you are short rather than long.`,

    description: `Hole 2 is one of the toughest challenges on the course and the second longest hole at 580 yards. Aiming your tee shot just right of the large tree in the middle is perfect, but a wide fairway gives you plenty of room to work with on either side. For your second shot, try to reach — or ideally pass — the corner of the slight dogleg right to set up a shorter approach. Accuracy is key, as trees line both sides. The green is generously sized and slopes from back to front and left to right, so it's safer to miss slightly short or right for the best chance at a solid putt.`,

    description: `Hole 3 is a par 4 with a key dogleg, making club selection off the tee crucial. Reaching the corner is vital — it could take as little as 150 yards from the front tees or up to 180 yards from the back. There's out of bounds down the right and trees lining the left, so accuracy is essential. Once around the corner, you'll face an elevated green that slopes from back to front. With a ditch and out of bounds long, it's safer to miss short on your approach rather than risk going over.`,

    yards: 360,
    description: `Hole 4 is a par 4 with a slight dog-leg right that demands precision off the tee. With out of bounds on the right and a line of trees down the left, the sloping fairway — which tilts right to left — can easily funnel your ball into trouble. The ideal tee shot is straight over the black and white stake in the centre of the fairway. The approach is to a small green guarded by steep slopes on both sides, making accuracy essential. Attacking from the left side of the fairway gives a better angle, but missing the green can leave a challenging recovery due to the pronounced right-to-left slopes.`,

    description: `Hole 5 is a downhill par 3 with the tee elevated significantly above the green. With out of bounds on the right and trees lining the left, accuracy is key — the ideal shot is straight at the pin. Going long brings real trouble, so depending on course conditions, especially if it's playing firm and dry, there's no harm in landing the ball short and letting the natural slope feed it onto the green.`,

    holeNumber: 6,
    par: 4,
    yards: 480,
    description: `Hole 6, now rated the toughest on the course, is a long par 4 with a slight dog leg right. The tee shot is crucial — the fairway is relatively wide but bordered by ditches and trees on both sides. With the hole sloping from left to right, aiming just left of centre and letting the slope guide the ball is the ideal line.

The second shot is often lengthy, with a pond and ditch guarding the front of the green. Players must either carry the hazard confidently or lay up short and leave a controlled pitch in. Be cautious of missing left, as it leaves little room for recovery.

The green itself is generously sized but tricky, sloping from back to front. If the pin is at the front, avoid going long — a downhill putt or chip from the back can be very difficult to judge.`,

    description: `Hole 7 is a long par 3 where club selection and accuracy are key. The green is guarded by a front bunker, which, while challenging, is often a better miss than ending up long or wide. Trees line both the left and right sides, but there is ample space between them and the green.

The hole and green slope from right to left, so if you're going to miss, missing slightly left is the safer option and can leave an easier up-and-down.

    description: `Hole 8 may be a short par 4, but it still presents plenty of challenges. A well-placed layup off the tee is crucial—go too long and you risk bringing the pond and ditch into play. There is no room for error on the left, but the hole does open up slightly on the right if you have the distance to carry the trees.

The green features two distinct tiers, so it's important to take note of the flag position. Finding the correct tier can make a big difference in setting up a good birdie opportunity. The green also slopes subtly from back to front so try to avoid going long where possible.`,

    description: `Hole 9 is a challenging uphill par 4 that features a generous fairway, but straying too far left or right can quickly make your second shot much tougher. Staying central off the tee is key to setting up a manageable approach.

When approaching the green, be mindful of the pond short and right. If you're uncertain about your club selection or distance, it's safer to aim at the left side of the green or just left of it.

The green itself is a decent size, and club selection can make all the difference. With a slope from back to front, the ideal position is to finish below the hole—going long will leave a tricky downhill putt or chip.`,

    par: 5,
    yards: 580,
    description: `Hole 10 is a long par 5 with a slight dog leg left. It begins with a challenging tee shot through a narrow fairway — trees line the entire left side with out of bounds beyond them, while the right side offers plenty of room for longer hitters.

The second shot is crucial. The fairway narrows with trees on both sides, demanding accuracy. A ditch runs across the fairway, forcing you to choose: lay up short of the ditch for a longer approach, or carry it for a more rewarding position.

Approaching the green is equally tricky, guarded by bunkers front left and right. Both the fairway and green slope from front to back, so landing short and aiming between the bunkers is wise.

The green itself is challenging, sloping front to back and left to right, requiring careful putts or chips.`,

    description: `Hole 11 is a short uphill par 4 with a slight dog leg right. A well-placed tee shot is crucial, with out of bounds left and trees lining the right. The ideal drive lands atop the hill, centre fairway.

The approach demands precision — a pond guards the short left, and the green is surrounded by steep banks. Missing long is the most punishing, so aim to land it safely on the green.`,

    description: `Hole 12 is a short par 3, but don’t let the yardage fool you — precision is key. Out of bounds runs up the left-hand side, and a bunker guards the front right of the green.

The biggest danger lies long, where a steep bank behind the green quickly gives way to out of bounds. A controlled tee shot aimed to find the middle of the green is the smart play here.`,

    yards: 215,
    description: `Hole 13 is one of the more challenging par 3s on the course. With out of bounds running up the left, a straight tee shot is ideal, but there is some forgiveness if you miss slightly to the right.

Going long here is definitely to be avoided — behind the green is not a friendly place. In fact, being short can often work in your favour, as the fairway slopes down toward the green and can feed the ball nicely onto the putting surface.

The green itself slopes from front to back, so controlling your distance is crucial to avoid a tricky downhill putt.`,

    description: `Hole 14 is a short but demanding par 3 with very little margin for error. Out of bounds runs all the way down the left side, and missing right leaves you with a challenging uphill chip back onto the green.

A pond guards the front right, making club selection and accuracy absolutely vital off the tee. To add to the difficulty, there’s also out of bounds long, so controlling your distance is essential.

The green slopes from back to front, so being below the hole will leave you in a much better position for your putt.`,

    yards: 323,
    description: `Hole 15 is an uphill par 4 that demands a well-thought-out tee shot. Trees line both sides of the fairway—while it’s possible to recover if you find them, it’s best to avoid them entirely. A ditch runs across the middle of the hole, so you'll need to decide whether to lay up short or take on the carry for a much shorter approach to the green.

Approaching the green, be aware of two bunkers guarding the front left and right. Long is definitely not the place to be, as it’s all trees and trouble behind.

The green slopes from right to left, so try to leave your ball below the hole to give yourself the best chance at a good putt.`,

    yards: 377,
    description: `Hole 16 is a downhill par 4 with a slight dog leg left that demands precision off the tee. The entire left side is out of bounds, so it's crucial to stay away from that side. While there’s more room on the right, missing the fairway there can make your approach trickier. A ditch runs across the hole and should be comfortably carried with your drive, but be mindful of the pond further up the fairway—club selection is key to avoid bringing it into play.

The approach to the green is one of the most demanding on the course. There’s danger in every direction: out of bounds left and long, a pond to the right, and a ditch short of the green. Accuracy and club choice are absolutely essential if you want to walk away with a good score.`,

    description: `Hole 17 is a short uphill par 4 that presents both opportunity and risk. A ditch runs across the middle of the hole, so off the tee you’ll need to decide whether to lay up short or carry over it. For the longer hitters, reaching the green is a tempting option, but precision is crucial.

The green is tightly guarded — with trees surrounding it, and trouble particularly on the left and long, which should definitely be avoided. There’s a greenside bunker short right and left, also a fairway bunker on the left, about 50 yards short of the green, both of which add to the challenge. Strategic thinking and solid execution are key to making the most of this hole.`,

    yards: 187,
    description: `Hole 18 is a picturesque but testing downhill par 3 where accuracy is absolutely essential. Two ponds flank the green — the one on the left sits right beside it, while the one on the right is fed by a steep slope leading down from the green. Long of the green is also out of bounds, making distance control crucial.

The green itself is fairly narrow and slopes from back to front, so aiming to land your ball short and let it release onto the putting surface can often be the safest and smartest play. A well-judged shot here can set you up for a strong finish to the round.`,
